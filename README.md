# Basic Computer Architecture Simulation

This project is a simulation of a basic computer architecture implemented using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).
It provides functionalities to load instructions, display various registers, execute instructions, and simulate memory operations.

## Features

- Instruction Loading: Load instructions into the simulation, including support for HALT instructions.
- Register Display: Display various registers including Accumulator (AC), Program Counter (PC), Address Register (AR), Data Register (DR),
   Instruction Register (IR), Temporary Register (TR), and Memory Protection Register (MPR).
- Memory Simulation: Simulate memory operations with the ability to display memory contents.
- Instruction Execution: Execute loaded instructions and simulate arithmetic and logical operations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run the program using the following command:```bash
python basic_computer_architecture_simulation.py
